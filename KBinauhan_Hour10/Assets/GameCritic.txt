Is the game too easy or hard? The game might be a bit too easy in the original state. The amount of randomness just equated to the balls getting into the goal typically on their own without much player interaction, often when focusing onto one ball the another will get into their own goal by themselves.

What would make it easier or harder? What might make it harder is more obstacles or changes to the chaos balls that would allow for more player interaction and will generally hinder the colored balls into getting into the goal. As well as that, it could be timed so that there's actually pressure to get the balls into their goal.

What would give it a "wow" factor? I think what could add a "wow" factor is better visuals or sounds to give a better experience for the player, something to really make the game pop and be more appealing to the eyes/ears.

What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious? The fun part of the game is definitely the chaotic aspect of it all, having to keep track of what was going on and complete the game's goals during the process. A tedious part of the game was how unpredictable the balls can become, particularly when there's one ball left, with them randomly becoming violently fast within a second.
